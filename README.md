My name is Nick Taylor. I am a Senior Software Developer at DEV working on all things DEV. I am a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, (P)React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long long time ago, rugby. I am also not a big fan of spiders.
